# Tic Tac Duc

Horrible coded experiment of a self learning tic tac toe cpu in php.

## Don't expext anything..

This is a simple expiremnt that I coded in about half an hour, so please don't expect any eye candy or good structure in this.

If you want to try this out, feel free...

```bash
$ php -S localhost:8080
```

You can train the computer by simply executing the `train-rand.php` file.

```bash
$ php train-rand.php
```
